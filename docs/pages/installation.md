# Installation

To install NotPacked++, you can either download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/packing-box/packer-masking-tool/releases) or build it from source.

## Building from Source

To build NotPacked++ from source, you will need to have the following dependencies:

- [LIEF](https://lief.re/) - Library to Instrument Executable Formats
- [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) - GNU Compiler Collection


### LIEF Installation
You can install LIEF by running the following command:
```bash
./install_lief.sh
```
Or you can use the **Dockerfile** provided in the repository to build the tool, it will install all the dependencies for you.
```bash
docker build -t notpackedpp .
docker run -it notpackedpp -v `pwd`:/mnt/share notpackedpp
```

### Building NotPacked++
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can build the tool by running the following command:
```bash
make
```

> By default the Makefile compiles the tool with the LIEF library linked statically, which means the library is embedded into the executable tool to make it more portable but larger. If you want to link it dynamically, you can modify the Makefile accordingly.
